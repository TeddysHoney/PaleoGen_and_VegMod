# SOP: Sampling Macrofossils for aDNA analysis from lake sediment cores

This is Jynn's edition of macrofossil sampling for aDNA. Macrofossil aDNA sampling at UniBe is done under semi-clean conditions in a laminar-flow fumehood and in a clean suit.

## PPE
The first thing to do is to wear a clean suit. Take out a suit from the cabinet.
1. Put on a mask
2. Put on a pair of gloves, careful to avoid touching anything other than the rim of the glove with your bare hands
3. Put on the suit, careful that the sleeves of the suit do not touch the ground
>[!Important]
>If this is the first time you are wearing the suit, cut holes in the suit for your thumb
>
4. Turn on the Fumehood
5. Change your gloves. Then, with your thumbs through the thumb holes, put on another layer of gloves 

At this point, you can find a pair of googles in the fume hood and put them on. 

## Decontamination 
Due to the semi-clean condition of the lab, it is recommended that the area within the fumehood is assumed to be clean. All other surfaces are considered contaminated.  All material entering the fumehood must be bleached beforehand unless it was in another package.
All other additional decontamination measures can be taken at the discretion of the individual
>[!Tip]
>To bleach equipment before putting them in the fumehood, you can fill one of the buckets with bleach and water. Wash everything in this solution, then wipe it down with water before putting it in the fumehood.

## Sampling 
Sediments are cut with a sterile surgical knife. 
1. Cut out a slice of sediment
2. Transfer the sediment to a Petri dish
3. Remove the outer edge of the sediment
>[!Note]
>For small cores, all exposed surfaces should be removed
4. Transfer around 1/3 of the remaining sediment into a sterile container; this is for sedaDNA
5. Transfer the remaining 2/3 into another sterile container and add distilled water; this is for macrofossil aDNA
6. Decontaminate the working surface with bleach and water
7. Change gloves, and repeat the previous steps for each new sediment slice.

At this point, the sedaDNA containers can be stored in -20°C freezer until DNA extraction

## Macrofossil sieving 

### Connecting the pump
Connect the hose out of the smaller part of the pump to the drain and connect the otherside to a "drum". Place these in the fumehood.

### Sieving and sampling Macrofossils
1. Sieve samples as usual in the fumehood
2. Transfer the final sieved products into a petri dish (you can place anything noteworthy in the cover of the petri dish)
3. Identify interesting Needles, Periderms, and budscales for aDNA extraction and place them individually into 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes with new tweezers
