# SOP: Opening Big Cores for downstream aDNA analysis

This is the SOP for the opening of 8.5 diameter cores for downstream aDNA analysis. For this purpose, the process should be kept as clean as possible. Protocol requires *__two people__*.

*__All the cores you're opening should be in the lab with you at the start.__*

>[!Note]
> Please wear closed toe shoes and long pants in the lab as we are working with bleach.

## Setup: 

>[!Important]
> Ensure that the aDNA sign is on the door after you enter so people do not accidentally enter the lab while you're working
> Turn on the __computer__ when you first arrive and set up the camera before doing anything else.
> Please look above the scanner for detailed instructions
> Switch on the __fumehoods__ before you start. Fumehood will start beeping at some point. Press the button that is flashing.

## Opening Cores
1.  Wipe all surfaces and materials with the bleach solution, followed by deionized water.
2.  Place the core on to the core stand with the top side on the left and the seam pointing up. Remove the syran wrap.
4.  *__Change gloves__*, then get the two copper plates and push it through the core.
5.  Place half of the core off of the stand away from you and leave the other half on the stand with the sleeve facing down
6.  Slide/scrap the copper sheets off of the cores
   
>[!Warning]
> Do not lift the copper sheets off of the cores, as this might damage the core surface

8.  Take the half of the core you want to be scanned to the camera.

>[!Tip]
> At this point, one person (Person A) can start scanning the core according to the relevant instructions . *__They are not to touch the core under any circumstance.__*

7. The other person (Person B) can start wrapping the second half of the core and preparing it for storage
8. Person A can start cleaning up the dirt from the core stand and copper sheets while or after scanning while Person B can wrap the working core.
9. Bleach gloves, all materials, and working surfaces.
10. Repeat steps 2-9 for all subsequent cores.

You do not have to bleach the materials and working surfaces after the last core. However, ensure there are no dirt left on the countertops. 

## Removing PPE
Please avoid touching the suit itself with your bare hands when taking off the suit. The masks can be discarded after each session. Suits are discarded after the completion of each site. 

## Finishing up
Please place all materials back where you found them and take out the trash.
